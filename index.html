            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>4 years ago, I moved out to San Francisco where my love for technology blossomed. I graduated from WDI, a Web Development Immersive program offered by General Assembly in June, 2014. In four months I accumulated over 400+ hours of instruction and spent over 600+ hours coding. I developed proficiencies in Javascript, Angular, node.js, Rails, Ruby, Coffeescript, Meteor and more.</p>
            <p>I have a background in customer service, criminal justice and philosophy which honed my problem-solving and critical thinking skills, which I combine with my passion for programming and technology. I am always looking for like-minded individuals to learn from, to collaborate with, and help develop amazing products and ideas.</p>
            <p>When I am not on my laptop coding or programming, I love going to the beach, playing racquetball or playing chess in the park. Feel free to contact me through email, twitter or facebook. You can also check out my LinkedIn profile or Github. Cheers!</p>

              <h3>Starting a new app with the MEAN stack</h3>
              <p>So blogging is definitely on my todo list of things I need to do more of. Here was my first blog for beginners basically going step-by-step to make a new application with the MEAN (mongoDB, Express, Angular and Node) stack. I'll have more entries to come. Soon to come is making using angular-google-maps api and pure angular to build a front-end application.</br><a href="http://joshua-pearson.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">My Blog</a></p>

              <h3>Covered SF</h3>
              <p>This was my final project at GA's WDI and it was also my favorite. The site is designed to make it easy for anyone in San Francisco to search for doctors and physicians based on what health insurance they accept, focusing mainly on Covered California, our state's new health insurance exchange. It also allows for anyone to view reviews on those doctors and their locations through Google Maps and Yelp's API. In order to actually get this list of doctors, however, I had to make my own API since one didn't exist. I used ruby to make some scripts and manually get the information on each doctor off of their insurance's web directories.</p>

              <h3>Flightshare</h3>
              <p>This was my 2nd project at WDI and it was also a group project. The idea was to make it super easy to share flight information with anyone you choose as well as have the site update you automatically via text if your flight was delayed. The site was built using Ruby on Rails, Twilio's API and FlightStats API. I primarily worked on the backend, doing the database, the API calls, as well as the logic for the automated workers for sending emails and texts.</p>

              <h3>PetHub</h3>
              <p>This was my first big project at WDI and it shows. Built entirely in Ruby on Rails, it is fairly basic but the idea was interesting to me. Basically it is a pet sharing/social site so people that need their pets watched can loan them to people who want to watch pets for a few hours but are not able to own one.</p>

              <h3>Ritly</h3>
              <p>This was just a silly little weekend project that we did to simulate Bitly. The app takes any valid web address and shortens it so it can be more easily shared.</p>
